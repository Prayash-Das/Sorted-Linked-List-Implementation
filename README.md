# Sorted Number List Implementation with Linked Lists

This project implements a sorted, doubly-linked list for storing numbers. It includes functionality to insert numbers into the list while maintaining the sorted order and to remove numbers from the list.

## Files

- `Node.h`: Contains the definition of the `Node` class for a doubly-linked list node.
- `SortedNumberList.h`: Contains the definition of the `SortedNumberList` class for a sorted, doubly-linked list.
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main program logic for testing the sorted number list.

## Usage

To use this implementation, compile the `main.cpp` file along with the necessary header files (`Node.h` and `SortedNumberList.h`). The program takes a space-separated list of numbers as input and performs insertion and removal operations on the sorted list.

Example usage:

```bash
./main 77 15 -42 63.5
```

## Testing

You can test the functionality of the sorted number list by providing different input lists and observing the sorted output after each insertion or removal operation.
